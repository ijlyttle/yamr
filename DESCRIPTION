Description: If you use Microsoft 'Yammer', you can embed 'Yammer' items into
 'web pages you create using 'R Markdown'. For example, if you run a blog 
 within your institution, and your institution uses 'Yammer', this can be a
 useful way to embed discussion and comments into your blog posts - while 
 respecting the IT choices of your institution.
