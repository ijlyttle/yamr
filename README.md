The goal of **yamr** is to make it easier for you to embed Yammer items
into your web-pages. This can be a way for you to embed a comments
section into your page using Yammer. This may be of interest if you are
working within an institution that has a private instance of Yammer.

## Installation

You can install the development version of yamr from GitHub:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packges("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ijlyttle/remotes")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(yamr)

# embed_yammer()
```
